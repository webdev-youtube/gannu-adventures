        <h1 id="chapter1">Chapter 1: The Beginning</h1>
        <p>   There once lived a dog named gannu. The was a very good girl and always listened to what was told to him. He was loved by all. He had a special ability that no other animal on borkth (that’s the planet’s name) had. He could speak in a language that only HUMAN understood but he could speak other languages like a good dog, somehow cat, and monkey language. He lived a happy life until one day…
</p>

        <h1 id="chapter2">Chapter 2: The Calamity Occurs</h1>
        The people there had a pretty good understanding of science and the universe as they were in the year 3000. They could stop most threats with technology, but they didn’t expect this. All scientists on borkth saw that a supernova was going to happen 10 lightyears away from the planet. But the problem was that the radius was sooooooooo big that it covered a radius of 20 lightyears. They didn’t have time to evacuate all people of borkth and didn’t have enough time to move the sun to a different place so they decided that they would send some animals to a second backup planet called just BORK. Some of the animals included gannu and a CAT. Gannu didn’t want to leave his owner aggu but he had to. Aggu also forced his friends atharv and divyaansh to go with gannu so he does not feel lonely and so that they can be safe. Some others also went.

        <h1 id="chapter3">Chapter 3: A Gift Before Launch</h1>
        Agastya gave him a gift and told him to use it in an only emergency.
        It had a block thing and a piece of paper that said something that gannu didn’t understand yet. Then the launch began. Because the planet had a high level of technology it has near-light speed rockets ( 99.748%). So, they took like an hour.

        <h1 id="chapter4">Chapter 4: Landing</h1>
        When they were about to land the rocket had a software error and thus the rocket was about to crash. Gannu was a great pilot however and the helped fix the rocket as it had a software repair function. Then they landed and found that the rocket was out of fuel so they were stuck until a spare fuel tank was sent. They started to set their tents and the cats were already done. Any cats came so they could do one at a time.

        <h1 id="chapter5">Chapter 5: A Strange Feeling</h1>
        While gannu was making his tent he felt a bit tired so he told to someone to please make his tent as he was very tired. He felt his energy drain and he was attracted to the gift by aggu. He went to it and found out that he could disassemble it and reshape it into anything he wanted.
        He also found out that he can stop time if he removes one piece of it, which was smaller than the rest. he still didn’t understand what the paper meant but he would soon. He tinkered around with it and had lots of fun but he didn’t know that something very bad would happen by someone who came with the whole crew. He also told atharv and divyaansh who didn’t believe him so he did something and then they were very shocked.

        <h1 id="chapter6">Chapter 6: fun! ... maybe?</h1>
        Now gannu and his friends had an idea to have fun. But before they could start they had to check something. Gannu had to see if he could not pause his friends if he paused the time by removing the small piece. He told his friends that he was going to check this and they were ready. He told them to hold his back. He then counted down since he had only done this once and this time pausing thing was still new to him.  3   2   1.
 He removed the smallest centerpiece. It worked. Everything had stopped as if it all were a statue, and all the people stopped like statues. The dogs and the CAT that went with them (yes only one cat came)	, the other animals and even all the non-living things, just stopped. He then told his friends to do something, And they moved! It worked! They could move just by holding gannu. But they as soon as they stopped being in contact of the doggo, they paused as well… Gannu was saddened. He couldn’t have fun like he wanted to. He put the piece back and everything went back to normal. Everything was unpaused again and he told Sudeep about his findings. He also told Sudeep to tell Gyan about it as pausing time really takes his energy. He went to his now-ready tent and had a good night’s sleep like a VERY GOOD BOI.
